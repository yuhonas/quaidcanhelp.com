# learntlist.com [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/yuhonas/learntlist.com.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/yuhonas/learntlist.com)

A dispassionate list of day to day learnings

## Why?

This is mostly a personal project that may have some wider appeal but for the last four years
I've kept a notebook of learnings in [evernote](https://evernote.com/features/webclipper) thing's I uttered thats interesting! and wished to revise at some point in the future, they were ingested into evernote in the following ways

1) Using the [evernote web clipper](https://evernote.com/features/webclipper) 
2) Adding a note that contains a short summary and a link to wikipedia (if an article resides there)

Lately I've been thinking

* How can I easily search/sort/view these learnings
* What's the ontology between all these items, what is the "bigger picture" 
* How could I present what i've learnt in a richer way
* How can I summarise/report on what i've learnt to reflect on it

Thankfully most of these are related to wikipedia articles from which I can derive structured content from, so... 

### Evernotes not the right fit, f*ck it, let's build something

First of all let's get the data out of evernote into something more usable, I dumped my entire notebok into the evernote [enml](https://dev.evernote.com/doc/articles/enml.php) format eg. `learnt-list.enex`, then I used [yq](https://github.com/kislyuk/yq) which has XML support to transform it into CSV and `COPY` it into Postgres

1) Exporting notes I added using the webclipper 

```bash
xq --raw-output '.[] | .note | [.[] | select(.["note-attributes"]["source-url"]| tostring | contains("wikipedia"))] | unique_by(.["note-attributes"]["source-url"]) | .[] |  [ .created, .updated, .title, .["note-attributes"]["source-url"] ] | @csv' learnt-list.enex | psql learntlist_dev -c "COPY learnt_items (inserted_at,updated_at,title,url) from STDIN DELIMITER ',' NULL '' CSV"
```

2) Exporting notes I added by hand that _somewhere_ in the body contained a wikipedia link

```bash
$ xq --raw-output '.[] | .note | .[] | select(.["note-attributes"]["source-url"] == null) | (.content |  capture("(?<url>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[\\w%]+)")) as $attributes | [ .created, .updated, .title, $attributes.url ] | @csv' learnt-list.enex | psql learntlist_dev -c "COPY learnt_items (inserted_at,updated_at,title,url) from STDIN DELIMITER ',' NULL '' CSV"
```
